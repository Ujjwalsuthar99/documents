Array 
Maximum subarray sum
question merge sort --> done
question 1 matrix --> done;
question 2 Pascal's Triangle --> not done
question 3 Next Permutation --> not done
question 4 kadane's theoram  --> done
question 5 sorting (merge sort, Dutch National flag algorithm) -->  done
6  --> buy sale --> done
7 rotatee matrix --> transpose and reverse --> done
8  merge overlapping subintervals --> not understand
9 merge too sorted arrays   --> 1st optimal approach
10 find-the-duplicate-number --> done
11. repeat and missing number -->hashing missing and repeating numbers--> done
12. Inversion of Array (Pre-req: Merge Sort)--> done with 2 loops 
but understood with merge sort
13 mergirg two sorted arrays with two pointer -->done
14 Search in a 2 D matrix --> flatten the 2d matrix and appply binary search to sort this 
getting row and col from mid by divide and module respectively
15. Pow(x, n)   --> 2^10 --> 4^5 --> 4 * 16^2  so on
	--> done
16. Majority Element (>n/2 times) --> done
17. Majority Element (n/3 times) --> done with hashsing only
18. grid unique paths --> not done
20. reverse pairs (hard) --> done but not fully understtod
21. two sum --> done
22 three sum --> hashing and two pointer need to write in the note book
23. longest consecutive sequence --> done

String 

reverse of string 3 questions --> done
1. "you look good" --> "good look you" --> string[]
2. "you look good" --> "doog kool uoy"  ---> 2 pointer
3. "r#aa$pid&&"  --> "d#ip$aar&&"   --> 2 pointer

4***. longest substring palindrome --> done need to write in the book (looking from around from current element)
5. roman to integer ---> done  (look for previous bigger than current word)
6. longest common prefix --> done very easy way by looking for two strings and find the common one out
and than just look for that common and next string

****####
7. TRIE  learn and there is problems related to that is word wrap
****####
8. 	Count and say --> not done
9. done


Linked List

middle 
length
reverse
merge two sorted
remove nth element from end
add two numbers as linkedlist
